// 1: Given let a = 3; and let x = 2 + (a /= 2);, what are the values of a and x?

// a is divided by 2, resulting in a becoming 1.
// Then, x is calculated as 2 + 1, which equals 3.
// So, a = 1 and x = 3.

// 2: If let a = 5; and let x = 3 * (a += 2);, what are the final values of a and x?

// a is increased by 2, becoming 7.
// Then, x is calculated as 3 * 7, which equals 21.
// Thus, a = 7 and x = 21.

// 3: Suppose let a = 4; and let x = 2 - (a *= 3);, what are the values of a and x after execution?

// a is multiplied by 3, resulting in a becoming 12.
// Then, x is calculated as 2 - 12, which equals -10.
// Hence, a = 12 and x = -10.

// 4: If let a = 6; and let x = 4 / (a /= 3);, what will be the values of a and x?

// a is divided by 3, becoming 2.
// Then, x is calculated as 4 / 2, which equals 2.
// Therefore, a = 2 and x = 2.

// 5: Given let a = 7; and let x = 5 % (a += 4);, determine the final values of a and x.

// a is increased by 4, becoming 11.
// Then, x is calculated as 5 % 11, which equals 5.
// Thus, a = 11 and x = 5.

// In each of these expressions, the value of a is modified based on the operation specified (e.g., +=, -=, *=, /=), and then the result is used in the calculation of x.
